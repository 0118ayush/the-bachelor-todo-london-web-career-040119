![bachelor holding a rose](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/web-dev-readme-photos/the-bachelor/The-Bachelor.jpg)

## Background

[The Bachelor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelor_%28U.S._TV_series%29) is a dating show that has celebrated over 19 seasons. As it turns out, your best friend is obsessed with The Bachelor and keeps asking you really strange questions, like, "What was the name of that girl who was a cruise ship singer?". 

You decided to scrape Wikipedia to get all the info on seasons 9 - 19 to help her answer these burning questions. Your task now is to create methods that navigate through this massive amount of data to find answers to her questions.

## Instructions

Take a look at `spec/fixtures/contestants.json`. This is the data that the spec will pass to your arguments, so get familiar with the way it is formatted.

Take a look at her questions:

1. Who won season 13?
2. What is the name of the woman whose occupation is cruise ship singer?
3. How many contestants have been from Brooklyn, NY over the season 9 - 19?
4. What was the occupation of the contestant from Cranston, Rhode Island?

Run your testing suite to get started.
